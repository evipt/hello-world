# hello-world

Hello viewer, 

I'm Evi and I finally got my hands on the coding world. As a math grad I'm pretty good with theorems concerning data and my weapons have always been pencil and paper. However I want to challenge myself with exploring and manipulating data with a more realistic approach, and that is nothing more than programming.
